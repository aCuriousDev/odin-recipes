Introduction
────────────
Odin Recipes is a simple website for recipes collection. Here the author will display his favorites meals and how to make them. This project is a great way to display basic HTML5 skills.

Project Description
───────────────────
Odin Recipes is build on HTML5 only, as of today, don't expect those beautiful CSS3 thingy here : It's BRUTAL art you ignorant *wink*.
There are 4 iterations :
1. Creation of the index.html
2. Creation of the first recipe page, within the recipes directory, and link it in the index.html page.
3. Add content to the recipe page : image, description, ingredients and steps.
4. Add two more recipes, all of them linked in the home page.

Learning Outcomes
─────────────────
First of all this project while using git and github is a good way to work on those skills. I'll be commiting, pushing and at last go live with github pages.
Then the website itself will be in plain HTML5 and will use links, images, lists (both ordered and unordered), titles and paragraphs.
I expect that this exercise will make me more comfortable with HTML, git and project structure.
